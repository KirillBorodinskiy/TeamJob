   abstract = {E-government is an implementation of ICT (information and communication technologies) in the field of governance in improving services to the public by a government or public sector. For example, Smart City, online licensing services, community complaint services, etc. The purpose of this research is to develop public complaint service application based on web application which uses springboot microservice architecture. Microservice architecture was used to divide the application functionality into many parts, or many micro-services based on business process and the services are interconnected, becoming a single application with a complete business process. One of the advantages of this architecture is that more microservice can be added without affecting others. The application was deployed in a cloud environment that can be accessed through a browser.},

The article presents the concepts that have to be dealt with when implementing the application in cloud environments and the technologies that were used in the applications, along with the justification of the choice. Scalability tests were carried out on two applications - monolithic with the use of Spring Boot and scalable with the use of Spring Boot and Spring Cloud. The research carried out in the article showed how to implement a scalable application using Spring Boot and Spring Cloud.},
